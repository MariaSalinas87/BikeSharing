# bikesharing

PURPOSE 

One of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

Checkout Times for Users

This graph shows the length of times that bikes were used measured by minutes.

Deliverable 2 

part A

This graph shows that same information as the graph above but broke down the usage by genders: males, females and unknown. It shows that male rented the bikes for longer amount of time.

Part B

This graph shows us the trips by the weekday per hour breakdown. We used the Start time by hour and the stop time by weekdays.  The busiest hours are 5pm and 6pm.

Part C
 The graph below shows the same information above but it has the gender filter. I used the Sum of Gender as a mark and filtered gender.

Part D 

The graph below shows trips by gender by weekday per hour and we can see that the busiest time for bike rental is between 6am and 88am as well as 5 pm and 6 pm .

Part E
This graph dividing the usertype of customer and subscriber. Most of the users are subscribers.

SUMMARY

Based on all of my research the bikes are mostly rented during work rush hour, at around 6pm to 8pm and 4pm to 6pm.
Two new additional visualizations I would recommend is one that compares August to holidays season like December and low season like April. This will be useful to see how lower and busier months do. The next one I would suggest, is for one that gets info for a more rural place not as busy at New York.
